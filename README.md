- **Search and Filter:** Homeowners can search for services by category, location, and rating, and filter the results to find the best match.
- **Booking System:** Homeowners can book services directly through the platform and manage their bookings.
- **Reviews and Ratings:** Homeowners can leave reviews and ratings for service providers to help others make informed decisions.
